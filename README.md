The book was first published in 2002 by Correveidile, a small independent publisher in Bolivia, and later reprinted by Mono Azul Editora in Spain in 2006. The book has been praised by critics and readers for its raw and honest style, its humor and irony, and its social and literary value. The book has also been translated into English, French, Italian, and Portuguese.
     
The title of the book comes from a phrase that Viscarra used to say when he was interviewed by journalists or researchers who wanted to know more about his life and his work. He would say that he was drunk but he remembered everything that happened to him, and he would tell his stories with remarkable detail and clarity. He would also say that he wrote his stories when he was sober, using a typewriter that he borrowed from a friend or a priest.
     
The stories in the book cover different aspects of Viscarra's life, such as his childhood, his family, his friends, his lovers, his enemies, his addictions, his crimes, his prison experiences, his encounters with death, and his views on society and politics. Some of the stories are humorous, such as "Coba, Lenguaje del Hampa Boliviano" (Coba, Language of the Bolivian Underworld), which is a dictionary of slang words and expressions used by criminals and outcasts in Bolivia. Other stories are tragic, such as "El Mandamiento de Apremio" (The Warrant of Arrest), which tells how Viscarra was arrested and tortured by the police for stealing a bottle of wine.

The book is not only a personal testimony of Viscarra's life, but also a portrait of a marginalized and forgotten sector of Bolivian society. Viscarra gives voice to the people who live in the streets, the slums, the prisons, and the hospitals, who suffer from poverty, violence, discrimination, and disease. He exposes the corruption and injustice of the authorities, the hypocrisy and indifference of the middle class, and the exploitation and oppression of the powerful. He also shows the solidarity and resilience of the people who struggle to survive and find some dignity and happiness in their lives.
     
Borracho Estaba Pero Me Acuerdo is a book that challenges and inspires the reader. It is a book that reveals the human condition in its most extreme and authentic form. It is a book that deserves to be read and remembered.
